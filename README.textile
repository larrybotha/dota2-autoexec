h1. Custom Dota 2 autoexec.cfg

This autoexec.cfg customises a number of features and bindings in Dota 2 so that console commands and settings can be run from a single command at the beginning of each match.

h2. Usage

Download and copy the autoexec.cfg to @Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\dota 2 beta\dota\cfg@

Open the file in a text editor, read through and modify the settings to your liking.

*Optional:* Run Dota 2 with console enabled, and disable the Valve intro video by adding

<pre>
  -console -novid
</pre>

to your launch parameters before starting Dota 2 (only needs to be done once):

Once in a match, execute the autoexec by pressing F8, or by opening your console with F11 and entering 

<pre>exec autoexec</pre>

h2. Key Bindings

To manage key bindings, do one of the following:

h4. Use Autoexec Key Bindings

Edit the bindings in the config to your liking, and then remove the default buttons in the Dota 2 option menu to prevent overwriting your bindings. To unbind a key in the options menu, select it and press DEL.

Or...

h4. Use Options-Defined Key Bindings

If you'd prefer to manage your key bindings via the Dota 2 settings, simply comment out or remove the bindings from the autoexec.cfg.

h2. Further Customisation
